# HTB's Cyber Apocalypse 2023 - The Cursed Mission

In this write-up my team solved mostly web challenges which some of them were really hard. Unlike past year's challenges, this time it felt like the difficulty was cranked up a notch.

We didn't manage to solve "TrapTrack" web challenge in time but we decided to share our work for it regardless
