# Ritsec 2023 CTF

In this write-up I'll discuss all the web challenges in this ctf, a steganography challenge and a bin-pwn challenge that we almost solved.

It also appears that the ctf organizers added a fifth web challenge that we weren't able to take a look at due to timezone differences.

It is a pickle exploitation challenge which is typical. ca23 had the same challenge but with even harder exploit chain so it's not that big of a deal.

here's a cool [write-up](https://siunam321.github.io/ctf/RITSEC-CTF-2023/Web/Pickle-Store/) for that challenge called Pickle Store
