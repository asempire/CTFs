# Rick Roll

This is a pretty straight forward challenge that was all about finding the flag pieces in the client source code.

```
_TuRna30unD_ in 1.html
RS{/\/eveRG0nna_] in 2.css
_|3tY0|_|d0vvn in 2.css
G1v3y0uuP in 1.css
_D3s3RTy0u} in Don't.html
```

Now the format of the flag was wacky, lien the letter `N` was formatted as `/\/` and `U` as `|_|` which can through someone off about the parts of the flag.

And of course the arrangement of the flag is dependant on how well you know the song (or how often you get rickrolled ;) )

```
RS{/\/eveRG0nna_G1v3y0uuP_|3tY0|_|d0vvn_TuRna30unD__D3s3RTy0u}
```
