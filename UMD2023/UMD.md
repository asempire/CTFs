# UMD 2023 CTF

This CTF was one of the hardest CTFs me and my team faced in a while. Since we are mostly oriented around web, and because of the blackbox nature of the web challenges.

We managed to solve 3 out of 6 web challenges and some OSINT and crypto challenges some of them are mentioned below.


## Table of contents

* WEB 
    - [TTS](./web/TTS.md)
    - [popcalc](./web/popcalc.md)
    - [notsogeo](./web/notsogeo.md)

* crypto
    - [pokecomms](./crypto/pokecomms.md)

* OSINT
    - [TCC](./OSINT/TCC.md)

It was a bummer that we weren't able to solve the other web challenges, but they needed so much time due to their nature (web assembly, obfuscated js and blackbox filters), but still it was a really fun CTF and really well maid one for sure.
